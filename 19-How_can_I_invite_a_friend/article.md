# How can I invite a friend?

Inviting a friend to LeagueSharp is really simple and you will be able to do it in minutes.

1. First of all navigate to the [Invite Friends](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=members&module=invite) area in your profile. 
2. Once you are there all you need to do is input their name in the 'Name' field and the email address you wish to invite in the 'Email Address' field. Once you've done that you can click on 'Submit'.

That's all you need to do. You can now navigate to [Pending Invites](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=members&module=invite&section=view&do=plist) or to [Converted Invites](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=members&module=invite&section=view&do=clist) to see the status of your invitations. You will also be able to see the name the member you invited chose for themselves in the forum.

Keep in mind that pending invites expire within 14 days and they are returned to you if nobody uses them.
