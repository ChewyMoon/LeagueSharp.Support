You can check the status of your payment on [www.paymentwall.com](www.paymentwall.com). When it says "Collected", you should already be Subscriber here. If not, please open a ticket. If it does not say "Collected", you most likely have to wait. You can also contact Paymentwall support to get information about your payment status.

###I still have an issue with my payment
If you have already contacted PayPal or Paymentwall and everything seems fine, please open a [support ticket](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=tickets&module=tickets&section=post&do=new_ticket) and include your transaction details, such as the Transaction ID or an image of your receipt.
