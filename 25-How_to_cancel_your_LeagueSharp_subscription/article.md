If you have paid using PayPal, you will be **automatically** charged when your subscription expires. If you do not want to extend your LeagueSharp subscription, you need to **cancel it through PayPal**. To do this, go to [PayPal's website](https://www.paypal.com/) and log into the account you used to buy the LeagueSharp subscription. After successfully logging in, you will notice a little gear next to the "logout" button on the top right side of the page. Click on the gear and scroll to the bottom of the page. There's a section named "**Payments**" on the bottom right. Follow the link there to the "[Pre approved Payments](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_manage-paylist)". Select the subscription you would like to **cancel**. On the bottom of the page you will see a "**Cancel Subscription**" button.
