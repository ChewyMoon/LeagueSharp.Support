Unfortunately, *"freezing"* or *"pausing"* a Subscription is not possible.

When purchasing a Subscription, be sure to be able to make use of it as we will not, **in any case**, pause it.

If you are not sure you will make use of a Subscription for the entire period, please consider buying a shorter Subscription package.
