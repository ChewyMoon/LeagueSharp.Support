To check if PayPal supports payments from your country, please check out [PayPal's official website](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide).

If you have a **verified** PayPal account you can continue with the following steps. If you have an *unverified* one, please skip the following steps.

In order to pay for a PlaySharp subscription using PayPal you need to navigate to the [store](https://www.joduska.me/forum/store/). Once there select your desired subscription and place it into your cart. You will be redirected to your cart where you can overview the articles you added. If you have made sure that everything is right you can continue by clicking on "Checkout". Once you've done that proceed by selecting "PayPal" as your preferred payment method. After confirming your order you will be redirected to PayPal, where you will have to login into your account using your PayPal credentials. After accepting the payment ("Agree and continue") you will be redirected to a website giving you an overview over the payment you just made. You will receive your subscription automatically afterwards.



In case that your PayPal account is **not verified** you need to purchase a *Gift Voucher*:
