In order to buy a Gift Voucher you need to navigate to the [store](https://www.joduska.me/forum/store/) and select "[Buy Gift Voucher](https://www.joduska.me/forum/store/gift-vouchers/)" on the left hand side. You are able to customize your Gift Voucher here but please keep in mind that our system does *not* send out the code *automatically*, you need to do it *manually*.
After selecting your prefered amount, your sending method ("Send Gift Voucher By Email" does not work - it does the same as "Print"), the Recipien'ts Name as well as your message (optional), you can proceed with a click on "Buy Gift Voucher". The following process is the same as buying a subcription (See also: <Article on how to buy a sub).
