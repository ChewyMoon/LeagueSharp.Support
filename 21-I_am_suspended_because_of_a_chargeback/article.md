We automatically lock your account as soon as you open a dispute on PayPal or Paymentwall for a payment towards us. 

We always try to provide the best service possible and we offer a wide range of support in case you are facing issues. Moreover, you can always contact us privately using the [Ticket System](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=tickets&module=tickets&section=post&do=new_ticket).

As soon as the dispute is fully closed and your payment is released to us, you will regain access to LeagueSharp again. If you are unable to close the dispute and wish to pay manually, please open a [ticket](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=tickets&module=tickets&section=post&do=new_ticket).
